# Euclidean Geometry
```ad-def
**Euclidean geometry** is a mathematical system attributed to [[Euclid]], which he described in his textbook on geometry: the _[Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_
Euclidean geometry is an example of [[synthetic geometry]].

## Axioms
Euclidean geometry is an [[axiomatic system]], in which all [[theorems]] are derived from a small number of simple axioms. Until the advent of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], these axioms were considered to be obviously true in the physical world, so that all the theorems would be equally true.
However, Euclid's reasoning from assumptions to conclusions remains valid independent of their physical reality.

Near the beginning of the first book of the *Elements*, Euclid gives five [[axiom]]s for [[plane geometry]], stated in terms of constructions

Let the following be postulated:

1. To draw a [[straight line]] from any point to any point.
2. To produce (extend) a [[finite straight line]] continuously in a straight line.
3. To describe a [[circle]] with any centre and distance (radius).
4. That all [[right angles]] are equal to one another.
5. The [[parallel postulate]]

Although Euclid only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructed objects, in his reasoning they are implicitly assumed to be unique.

The *Elements* also include the following five "common notions":

1. If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal (Addition property of equality).
2. Things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another (the [[transitive property]] of a [[Euclidean relation]]).
3. If equals are subtracted from equals, then the differences are equal (subtraction property of equality).
4. Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another (reflexive property).
5. The whole is greater than the part.

Modern scholars agree that Euclid's postulates do not provide the complete logical foundation that Euclid required for his presentation. Modern treatments use more extensive and complete sets of axioms.
