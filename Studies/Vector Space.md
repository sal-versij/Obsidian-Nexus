# Vector Space
In [[mathematics]], [[Physics]], and [[engineering]], a **vector space** (also called a **linear space**) is a set(see [[Set (mathematics)]]) of objects called [[Vector]]s, which may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by scalars. Scalars are often [[real numbers]], but some vector spaces have scalar multiplication by [complex numbers] or, generally, by a scalar from any mathematic field(see [[Field (mathematics)]]. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called vector axioms. To specify whether the scalars in a particular vector space are [[real numbers]] or [[complex numbers]], the terms **real vector space** and **complex vector space** are often used.
