# Euclidean space
```ad-def
In modern geometry, Euclidean spaces are often defined from [[linear algebra]]. More precisely, a [[Euclidean space]] $E$ is defined as a set to which is associated an [[inner product space]] of finite dimension over the reals $\overrightarrow {E}$ and a [[group action]] of the [[additive group]] of $\overrightarrow {E}$which is a [[free action]] and [[transitive]] (See [[Affine space]] for details of this construction). The elements of $\overrightarrow {E}$ are called [[translations]].
