## Vectors in [[Euclidean Geometry]]
```ad-def
In classical [[Euclidean geometry]], vectors were introduced as [[equivalence classes]] under [[equipollence]], of [[ordered pairs]] of points; two pairs $(A, B)$ and $(C, D)$ being equipollent if the points $A, B, D, C$, in this order, form a parallelogram. Such an equivalence class is called a *vector*, more precisely, a [[Euclidean vector]]. The equivalence class of $(A, B)$ is often denoted $\overrightarrow {AB}$.
A [[Euclidean vector]] is thus an equivalence class of directed segments with the same magnitude and same direction. 
```

In physics, Euclidean vectors are used to represent physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction, but are not located at a specific place, in contrast to [[scalars]].
For example, [[velocity]], [[forces]] and [[acceleration]] are represented by vectors.

In modern geometry, Euclidean spaces are often defined from [[linear algebra]]. More precisely, a [[Euclidean space]] $E$ is defined as a set to which is associated an [[inner product space]] of finite dimension over the reals $\overrightarrow {E}$ and a [[group action]] of the [[additive group]] of $\overrightarrow {E}$which is a [[free action]] and [[transitive]] (See [[Affine space]] for details of this construction). The elements of $\overrightarrow {E}$ are called [[translations]].

```ad-note
It has been proven that the two definitions of Euclidean spaces are equivalent, and that the equivalence classes under equipollence may be identified with translations.
```

Sometimes, Euclidean vectors are considered without reference to a [[Euclidean space]]. In this case, a [[Euclidean vector]] is an element of a normed [[vector space]] of finite dimension over the reals, or, typically, an element of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ equipped with the [[dot product]]. This makes sense, as the addition in such a vector space acts freely and transitively on the vector space itself. That is, $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a Euclidean space, with itself as an associated vector space, and the [[dot product]] as an [[inner product]].

The [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is often presented as ***The*** [[Euclidean space]] of dimension $n$. This is motivated by the fact that every [[Euclidean space]] of dimension $n$ is isomorphic(see [[isomorphism]]) to the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
More precisely, given such a Euclidean space, one may choose any point $O$ as an origin. By [[Gramâ€“Schmidt process]], one may also find an [[orthonormal basis]] of the associated vector space. This defines [[Cartesian coordinates]] of any point $P$ of the space, as the coordinates on this basis of the vector $\overrightarrow{OP}$.
These choices define an [[isomorphism]] of the given [[Euclidean space]] onto $\mathbb {R} ^{n},}![\mathbb {R} ^{n},](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d7035fcb9fe3ebecc6bc9f372f82d0352202c8bf) by mapping any point to the [n-tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") of its Cartesian coordinates, and every vector to its [coordinate vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector "Coordinate vector").
