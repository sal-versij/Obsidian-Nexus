### Amdahlâ€™s law
$$
S = \frac{1}{\frac{p_1}{s_1} + \frac{p_2}{s_2} + ... + \frac{p_r}{s_r}}
$$

> Focus on the larger part: better speed-up with less investment.

> Amdhal's law focuses on maximum speed-up assuming constant work (*strong scaling*). How about more work in the same time (*weak scaling*)?
