# Stream processing
```ad-def
**Stream processing** is a [[computer programming]] paradigm, equivalent to [dataflow programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming "Dataflow programming"), [event stream processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_stream_processing "Event stream processing"), and [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming "Reactive programming"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing#cite_note-1) that allows some applications to more easily exploit a limited form of [parallel processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing "Parallel computing").
