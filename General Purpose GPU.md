### Demand & Supply
#### Demand
- ***monitoring***
  huge amounts of data to analyze in real time;

- ***modelling***
  study, validation and application of models (economics, geophysics, mechanics, …);

- ***simulations***
  forecasting (e.g. meteorology), scenarios for a variety of phenomena (natural disaster, infrastructure failure, …)
#### Supply
- ***cluster***
  traditional solution; n computer (nodes) connected with high-speed networks;

- ***GPU***
  recent ‘accidental’ solution: originally developed for videogames, people find they are also excellent for general-purpose parallel computing

- ***accelerators***
  takes off from the success of GPUs, rely on the same principles, but lack graphics specialization (e.g. Xeon Phi).
