# Euclidean Vector
```ad-def
In [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]], an **Euclidean vector** or simply a [[vector]] (sometimes called a **geometric vector** or **spatial vector**) is a geometric object that has *magnitude* and *direction*. Vectors can be added to other vectors according to [[vector algebra]]. A Euclidean vector is frequently represented by a *ray*, or graphically as an arrow connecting an *initial point* $A$ with a *terminal point* $B$, and denoted by $\overrightarrow {AB}$.

In classical [[Euclidean geometry]], vectors were introduced as [[equivalence classes]] under [[equipollence]], of [[ordered pairs]] of points; two pairs $(A, B)$ and $(C, D)$ being equipollent if the points $A, B, D, C$, in this order, form a parallelogram. Such an equivalence class is called a *vector*, more precisely, a [[Euclidean vector]]. The equivalence class of $(A, B)$ is often denoted $\overrightarrow {AB}$.
A [[Euclidean vector]] is thus an equivalence class of directed segments with the same magnitude and same direction.

Sometimes, Euclidean vectors are considered without reference to a [[Euclidean space]]. In this case, a [[Euclidean vector]] is an element of a normed [[Vector Space]] of finite dimension over the reals, or, typically, an element of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ equipped with the [[dot product]]. This makes sense, as the addition in such a vector space acts freely and transitively on the vector space itself. That is, $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a Euclidean space, with itself as an associated vector space, and the [[dot product]] as an [[inner product]].

The [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is often presented as ***The*** [[Euclidean space]] of dimension $n$. This is motivated by the fact that every [[Euclidean space]] of dimension $n$ is isomorphic(see [[isomorphism]]) to the [[Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
More precisely, given such a Euclidean space, one may choose any point $O$ as an origin. By [[Gramâ€“Schmidt process]], one may also find an [[orthonormal basis]] of the associated vector space. This defines [[Cartesian coordinates]] of any point $P$ of the space, as the coordinates on this basis of the vector $\overrightarrow{OP}$.
These choices define an [[isomorphism]] of the given [[Euclidean space]] onto $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, by mapping any point to the n-tuple of its Cartesian coordinates, and every vector to its [[coordinate vector]].
